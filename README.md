# Minecraft Shaders
My shaderpack for Minecraft, written for use with Iris Shaders, compatibility with Optifine is not guaranteed.

# Features
* Multiple profiles suited for wide range of hardware (Lite, Low, Medium, High, Ultra) removed as shaderpack is still wip, settings menu is done
* Shadow filtering (soft shadows)
* Colored transparent shadows
* Sharpening
* Atmospheric scattering simulation for sky
* Volumetric clouds
* Bloom (glow effect)
* Retro filter (disabled in settings)
* Sun glow effect
* Automatic exposure (based on sky light)
* Sky reflection on water and on land when raining
* Custom stars

# TODO
* Screen-space reflections
* Rewrite volumetric clouds (they are kinda sloow)
* Terrain wind

# Known issues
* none (yet)
