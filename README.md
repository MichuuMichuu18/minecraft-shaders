# Minecraft Shaders
My shaderpack for Minecraft, written for use with Iris Shaders, compatibility with Optifine is not guaranteed.

# Features
* Multiple profiles suited for wide range of hardware (Lite, Low, Medium, High, Ultra)
* Diffuse lighting
* Screenspace fog
* Desaturation filter
* Day/night cycle support
* FXAA
* Shadow filtering (soft shadows)
* Colored transparent shadows
* Sharpening
* Volumetric clouds
* Bloom (glow effect)
* Retro filter (disabled by default in settings)

# TODO
* Water shader with SSR
* Custom stars
* 2D clouds
* Use noisetex for volumetric clouds noise (filtering done, clouds map wip)
* Change sky colors

# Known issues
* Sky changes between day and night when player is looking straight up
